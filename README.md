# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
The **Predict Customer Churn** project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer churn for a business. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a product or service. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction. This project involves analyzing historical customer data, identifying key features that contribute to churn, and building a predictive model using various machine learning algorithms. The ultimate goal is to create a reliable churn prediction system that can be integrated into the business operations to reduce customer attrition and increase revenue.

## Files and data description
The root directory contains the following files and data:

1. `data.csv`: This file contains the historical customer data used for the analysis and model development.

2. `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and its objectives.

3. `churn_model.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code for analyzing the data, building the predictive model, and evaluating its performance.

4. `requirements.txt`: This file lists the dependencies and packages required to run the code in `churn_model.ipynb`.

5. `output/`: This directory stores the output files generated during the analysis, such as visualizations and model evaluation results.

Please make sure to have the necessary data file (`data.csv`) in the root directory before running the code in `churn_model.ipynb`.

## Running Files
To run the files, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have all the required dependencies and packages listed in `requirements.txt` installed in your environment.

2. Open the `churn_model.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

3. Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

4. Review the output files generated in the `output/` directory for visualizations and model evaluation results.

By running the files, you will be able to analyze the historical customer data, build a predictive model for customer churn, and evaluate its performance.
